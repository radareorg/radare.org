<h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>
<h3 id="latest-news-in-r2land">Latest news in r2land</h3>
<p>(pancake) - 30m</p>
<p>Lots of things has changed in a year, reading git log can be boring
and release notes are usually not explicative enough to catch all the
juicy improvements the whole radare2 ecosystem provides. This talk will
cover you up and you will learn all the stuff you missed as well as
spoiling some of the future plans in the roadmap</p>
<h3 id="debugging-emulated-processes-with-mwemu">Debugging emulated
processes with mwemu</h3>
<p>(sha0) - 30m</p>
<p>Windows process emulation was already possible with mwemu, and in
most of cases was very effective for emulating small group of functions,
decrypting stuff, etc. However full-emulation of the malware was
something like an utopia. Latest improvements by mwemu team alow the
reverser do analysis with radare2 from inside the emulated process. This
is useful for inspecting memory data chunks, but also code analysis,
functions recognizement, decompilers, ai, or any of the zillions of
radare2 features.</p>
<h3 id="when-worlds-collide-r4ghidra">When Worlds Collide: r4ghidra</h3>
<p>(buherator) - 30m</p>
<p>R4Ghidra is a full rewrite of the radare2 commandline parser and the
most representative commands in pure Java. Yeah that sounds weird, but
how does having all your favorite commandline oneliners and scripts to
work inside Ghidra without depending on external binaries? What if
radare2 can talk to your current Ghidra project and get all the metadata
in sync? We will Highlight the challenges and opportunities of reverse
engineering tool integration based on lessons learned from r4ghidra
development.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-engineering-solana-programs-with-radare2">Reverse
Engineering Solana Programs with radare2</h3>
<p>(ulexec + secoalba) - 30m</p>
<p>An Introduction to the Solana runtime and the sBPF architecture with
the brand new sBPF plug-in in radare2</p>
<h3
id="chameleon-polymorphic-engine-for-position-independent-shellcode">Chameleon:
polymorphic engine for position independent shellcode</h3>
<p>(gum3t) - 30m</p>
<p>Chameleon is a polymorphic engine for <code>x86_64</code>
position-independent shellcode that has been created out of the need to
evade signature-based detections in red team environments.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-radare2-from-anywhere-anytime">Accessing radare2 from
anywhere, anytime</h3>
<p>(AbhiTheModder) - 15m</p>
<p>Introduction to r2web, which brings the webassembly builds radare2 to
the browser while still being totally client-side, enabling quick,
setup-free reverse engineering for education, collaboration, and
lightweight analysis. We’ll also cover current limitations and future
plans for cross-platform improvements.</p>
<h3 id="refreshing-the-state-of-parsing-disassembly">Refreshing the
state of parsing disassembly</h3>
<p>(satk0) - 15m</p>
<p>Parsing disassembly has been always a quick and dirty way to extract
information from the code, but also to improve the readability replacing
inmediates with symbolic information like local variables or function
names. This feature has been also very useful for translating any
architecture into pseudocode which let high level decompilers like Decai
to handle lots of targets with very little effort. During the transition
from 5.9 to 6.0, radare2 changed the way these APIs work and improved
the state of the art by introducing plugins and generic APIs to help
developers reduce code complexity and maintainability while producing
more solid results.</p>
<h3 id="automated-binary-morphing-and-evasion-analytics">Automated
Binary Morphing and Evasion Analytics</h3>
<p>(seilfreed) - 30m</p>
<p>This talk introduces r2morph, a framework for transforming binaries
while preserving their behaviour. Built on radare2, it performs
semantic-aware mutations such as instruction substitution, NOP
insertion, and control-flow flattening. We’ll explore its architecture,
multi-architecture support, and practical uses in obfuscation, evasion
testing, and binary research, with live examples of extending it through
custom mutation passes.</p>
<h3 id="vibereversing-binaries-with-r2mcp">Vibereversing binaries with
r2mcp</h3>
<p>(pancake) - 30m</p>
<p>AI is rapidly transforming the way we work, and MCPs open the door
for agents to seamlessly use tools and tackle complex problems. They not
only help users learn new tools without digging through documentation
but also provide a powerful way to accelerate reverse engineering
workflows across diverse toolchains.</p>
<h3 id="devirtualizing-vm-based-obfuscation-in-android">Devirtualizing
VM-Based Obfuscation in Android</h3>
<p>(Ahmethan Gultekin) - 30m</p>
<p>In this presentation we’ll dive into how virtual machines tick, how
VM-based obfuscation is applied in Android apps, and how r2 can be used
to crack open those layers and devirtualize them.</p>
<h3 id="reversing-android-rasp-using-radare2-frida">Reversing Android
RASP using Radare2 &amp; Frida</h3>
<p>(apkunpacker) - 30m</p>
<p>Practical use of radare2 &amp; frida to efficiently analyze RASP
checks during RE</p>
<h3 id="crack-rust-with-r2ai">Crack Rust with r2ai</h3>
<p>(cryptax) - 30m</p>
<p>Have you ever reversed Rust binaries? No? Lucky you! Simple code
turns into 600+ functions, and many of its concepts have impact on the
way to reverse it: println is a macro, strings are fat pointers,
compiler uses monomorphization… So, how can we solve a Rust CrackMe? We
are going to use r2ai - r2’s Artificial Intelligence plugin. It helps,
but we’ll nevertheless need practice and brains ;P</p>
<h3 id="revamping-rfs">Revamping rfs</h3>
<p>(mikelloc) - 30m</p>
<p>Join us for a fast-paced overview of the recent enhancements to
radare2’s filesystem library. We’ll explore the addition of UBIFS
support, the introduction of a visual, interactive interface for
filesystem navigation, and new capabilities for extracting metadata and
recovering on-disk file locations. Learn how these improvements fill in
the missing bits and open up new possibilities for filesystem analysis,
debugging, and forensics in radare2.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-insights-for-malware-analysts">Rapid Insights for Malware
Analysts</h3>
<p>(seifreed) - 30m</p>
<p>Presenting <code>r2inspect</code>: a framework for static malware
analysis built on top of radare2 and r2pipe, providing accurate
detection of obfuscated strings, cryptographic signatures, exploit
mitigation analysis, and more</p>
<h3 id="using-r2-to-uncover-mobile-app-weaknesses">Using r2 to Uncover
Mobile App Weaknesses</h3>
<p>(grepharder) - 30m</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll dice into common mobile app weaknesses from the
OWASP MASWE catalogue and demonstrates how to uncover them in practice.
Using radare2 and other essential tools from the OWASP MASTG, we will
solve reverse engineering challenges and validate MASTG tests step by
step. All challenges will be available as APK and IPA files for hands-on
practice. Will we also use AI to tackle some of these challenges?
Maybe.</p>
<h3 id="toctou-maps">TocTou Maps</h3>
<p>(pancake) - 30m</p>
<p>Accessing buffers is always tricky—especially when mmap comes into
play. This talk dives into a subtle bug in radare2 that uncovered a
series of non-portable syscalls and broader portability issues. Along
the way, we’ll explore how operating systems manage memory and how these
details can lead to vulnerabilities in modern software. If you’re
curious about low-level memory handling and hidden pitfalls, this is a
session you won’t want to miss.</p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p>(pancake) - 10m</p>
