We are proud to announce r2con2025!

It's late and informal, as we used to be, despite the tight timing and real life never stops to put rocks on the road the project moves on and the community deserves to be expressed, share its research, discuss the development changes and show case all the shiny new features we have been working with passion over the year.

At this point you may probably have lots of questions about dates, location, prices.. and we want to keep it as simple as possible, don't worry about booking hotels, as we plan to make it online this time, with local meetup if we can wrap it up, but that shouldn't block the CFP.
