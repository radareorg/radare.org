Avatao R3v3rs3 4 

After a few years of missing out on wargames at Hacktivity[1], this year I've finally found the time to begin, and almost finish (yeah, I'm quite embarrassed about that unfinished webhack :) ) one of them. There were 3 different games at the conf, and I've chosen the one that was provided by avatao[2]. It consisted of 8 challenges, most of them being basic web hacking stuff, one sandbox escape, one simple buffer overflow exploitation, and there were two reverse engineering exercises too. You can find these challenges on https://platform.avatao.com.
