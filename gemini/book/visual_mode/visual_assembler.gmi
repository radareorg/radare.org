# Visual Assembler

You can use Visual Mode to assemble code using `A`.

For example let's replace the `push` by a `jmp`:

Before[1]

=> before.png 1: Before

Notice the preview of the disassembly and arrows:

After[1]

=> after.png 1: After

You need to open the file in writing mode (`r2 -w` or `oo+`) in order to patch the file.

You can also use the cache mode: `e io.cache = true` and `wc?`.

Remember that patching files in debug mode only patch the memory not the file.
