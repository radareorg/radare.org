## Disassembler Configuration

The assembler and disassembler have many small switches to tweak the output.

Those configurations are available through the `e` command. Here there are the most common ones:

- asm.bytes - show/hide bytes
- asm.offset - show/hide offset
- asm.lines - show/hide lines
- asm.ucase - show disasm in uppercase
- ...

Use the `e??asm.` for more details.
