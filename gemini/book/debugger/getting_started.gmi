# Getting Started

## Small session in radare2 debugger

- `r2 -d /bin/ls`: Opens radare2 with file `/bin/ls` in debugger mode using the radare2 native debugger, but does not run the program. Youâ€™ll see a prompt (radare2) - all examples are from this prompt.
- `db flag`: place a breakpoint at flag, where flag can be either an address or a function name
- `db - flag`: remove the breakpoint at flag, where flag can be either an address or a function name
- `db`: show list of breakpoint
- `dc`: run the program
- `dr`: Show registers state
- `drr`: Show registers references (telescoping) (like peda)
- `ds`: Step into instruction
- `dso`: Step over instruction
- `dbt`: Display backtrace
- `dm`: Show memory maps
- `dk <signal>`: Send KILL signal to child
- `ood`: reopen in debug mode
- `ood arg1 arg2`: reopen in debug mode with arg1 and arg2
